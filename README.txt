	For developers:

Our web application is built using the Flask framework in Python, incorporating a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for efficient data handling. HTML templates with Jinja2 provide dynamic content rendering, while CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing design across devices. The asynchronous features enhance user experience, with JavaScript managing client-side interactions and AJAX requests.

The backend utilizes SQLite for data storage, with SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, ensuring a structured and efficient database schema. RESTful API endpoints are implemented to handle data retrieval and modification securely.

To enhance user engagement, cookies are employed for storing user preferences, such as accepted terms and saved task IDs. Additionally, an animated loading screen with dynamic overflow control creates a polished and user-friendly interface. Code modularity is emphasized, promoting maintainability and scalability.

In summary, our web application seamlessly blends Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an intuitive, feature-rich, and responsive educational platform for both contributors and learners.
